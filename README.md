# Machine Learning of ARX Models of Dynamical Systems Using Keras and MLP networks

This project deals with learning the ARX model of a dynamical system. We use an MLP network to estimate the ARX model. 
There are two files: 
 1.- "system_identification_ARX.py" - is the main file
 2.- "backward_euler.py" - is the file called from the first file, this file is used to simulate the system
 

I wrote a detailed post about this project. It can be found here:
